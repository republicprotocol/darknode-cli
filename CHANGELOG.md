New CLI for Chaosnet darknodes deployment. 

> Since the config format for darknode is changed and we move from terraform 0.11.x to 0.12.x. New cli will not be backwards compatible with old darknodes. Users need to deregister and destroy old nodes first before updating to this version.

Changelog:
- Windows support with WSL
- Use updated `terraform` version `v0.12.12`
- Release check before running any commands, it will warn users if they are using an old version.
- Support `start/stop/restart` commands to start/stop/restart the service on darknode.
- Add `exec` command which allow users to run script/file on remote instance.
- Add `register` command which shows the link to register a particular node and try opening it using the default browser. 
- Show provider information when running `darknode list`
- `resize` command will not increase the disk size for digital ocean. (This allows users to downgrade their droplets after upgrading the plan) 
- Detail monitoring is enabled for all providers. 
- Code has been refactored to be self-contained
